Minimal REST API

Setup
-----

- Install Python 2.7 and git.
- Run 'setup.sh' (Linux)
- Run './server.py' to start the server
- Now you can work with the server via REST API by accessing the 'http://localhost:5000/' address
- Run './server-test.py' to execute tests


All data are persisted across server restarts and saved in 'users.db' file
